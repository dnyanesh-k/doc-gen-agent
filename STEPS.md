# Step-by-Step Learning Guide

## Step 1.1: Project Structure ✅

**What we're doing**: Set up basic folder structure

**What we're learning**: Project organization, Python package structure

**Files created**:
- `src/` - Source code directory
- `prompts/` - Prompt templates
- `tests/` - Test files
- `output/` - Generated documentation
- `config.yaml` - Configuration file

**Next**: Step 1.2 - Git change detection

---

## Step 1.2: Git Change Detection (Next)

**What we're doing**: Detect what files changed in git

**What we're learning**: 
- Git commands (`git diff`, `git status`)
- Python subprocess module
- File path handling

**Concept**: How to programmatically interact with git

**Implementation**: Simple script that runs `git diff --name-only`

---

## Step 1.3: File Pattern Matching

**What we're doing**: Match changed files against patterns

**What we're learning**:
- Glob patterns (`*.py`, `src/**/*.js`)
- Pattern matching algorithms
- Configuration-driven logic

**Concept**: How to categorize files by patterns

---

## Step 1.4: Basic Config System

**What we're doing**: Load and use YAML configuration

**What we're learning**:
- YAML syntax
- Python YAML parsing (`pyyaml`)
- Configuration management

**Concept**: Separating code from configuration
